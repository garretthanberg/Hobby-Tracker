During my impactful internship at Prosper I.T. Consulting, I had the privilege of collaborating with a dynamic team on a Python Django web application. This project provided me with invaluable exposure to a legacy codebase, where I enthusiastically undertook the responsibility of implementing new features, resolving bugs, and enhancing the overall user experience. This immersive experience served as a transformative learning opportunity, equipping me with the skills to navigate existing codebases and deliver exceptional products within tight deadlines.

Throughout the intensive sprints during the project, I eagerly undertook a range of back-end stories that have left an indelible mark on my professional growth. These stories, which I take immense pride in, allowed me to showcase my technical prowess and contribute significantly to the project's success. In addition, I enthusiastically embraced the opportunity to work on front-end stories and UX improvements, which presented their own unique set of challenges. Our cohesive team fostered an environment of equal opportunity, ensuring that each team member had the chance to explore and contribute to both front-end and back-end functionalities.

# Learned Skills

During my time working on the Python Django web application with a group of developers, I gained a variety of skills that go beyond coding. One of them is the ability to work with other developers to identify and fix both front-end and back-end bugs to enhance the overall user experience. Another skill I developed was improving project flow by maintaining open communication and coordinating who needs to check out specific files for their current story. Observing the workflow of my fellow developers was also a valuable learning experience. I learned some new efficiencies and techniques by asking questions and taking note of their practices. Working collaboratively on pair programming and team programming was another skill I honed during this project.
