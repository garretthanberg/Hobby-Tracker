# Hobby-Tracker Introduction:

During my first project at Prosper I.T. Consulting, I worked with a team to develop a Python Django web application. This project gave me the opportunity to work with a legacy codebase and implement new features while fixing bugs and improving the user experience. It was a great learning experience that taught me how to work with existing code to deliver a quality product on time.
During the two-week sprint, I worked on several back-end stories that I'm proud of. I also had the opportunity to work on front-end stories and UX improvements, which varied in difficulty. Our team made sure that everyone had a chance to work on both front-end and back-end stories.
I also developed my project management and team programming skills, which I'm confident will be useful in future projects. In the following sections, I will describe the stories I worked on, along with relevant code snippets. Additionally, some of the larger functionalities I implemented have full code files available in this repository.

# Learned Skills

During my time working on the Python Django web application with a group of developers, I gained a variety of skills that go beyond coding. One of them is the ability to work with other developers to identify and fix both front-end and back-end bugs to enhance the overall user experience. Another skill I developed was improving project flow by maintaining open communication and coordinating who needs to check out specific files for their current story. Observing the workflow of my fellow developers was also a valuable learning experience. I learned some new efficiencies and techniques by asking questions and taking note of their practices. Working collaboratively on pair programming and team programming was another skill I honed during this project.
